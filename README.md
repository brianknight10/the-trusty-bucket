### A Note on the Scripts

The scripts included in this repository are for illustrative and educational purposes. They are not production-ready, do not recover from exceptions, or representative of best-practices. Imagine they are being entered line-by-line at the command prompt. They are here to promote discovery.

I opted to use Python for these scripts because, having written in Ruby, Go, and JavaScript for years, I thought it would be fun to try them in a new language. Please feel free to amend them and convert them to a language of your choice.
